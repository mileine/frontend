### Learning Vuex by Example

[This tutorial](https://coursetro.com/posts/code/144/A-Vuex-Tutorial-by-Example---Learn-Vue-State-Management) helped me understand about how [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) works.

Learning how state management works in Vue.js gave me a better idea of how components communicate and i
nteract with each other.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a simple web app where you will be able to manage a list of links and keep the list status updated on the screen. 

Although it might sound like a simple app, you'll get to learn a lot about:
- setup a basic mechanism for state management of a list
- how to call the getters, mutations, actions from the components
- how to update information in a component that uses the same value that was changed in another component
- how to import components in Vue.js

Very easy to follow and a great start to Vuex - I can say it did save my day (or maybe my week) at work! =)

You can also learn about Vuex from the video tutorial:
